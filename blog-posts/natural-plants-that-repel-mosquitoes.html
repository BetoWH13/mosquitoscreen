            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Mosquito-Repelling Plants</h2>
            
            <h3>Do mosquito-repelling plants actually work?</h3>
            <p>Yes, but with limitations. Scientific studies confirm that many plants contain compounds that repel mosquitoes. However, these compounds are most effective when extracted as oils or crushed to release their scents. Simply having the plants nearby provides some benefit, but for maximum protection, they should be part of a comprehensive mosquito control strategy.</p>
            
            <h3>How many plants do I need for effective mosquito control?</h3>
            <p>For a typical patio or small yard area (about 200 square feet), aim for 5-7 potted plants of different varieties placed strategically around the perimeter and seating areas. Larger spaces will require more plants or concentrated plantings near high-traffic areas.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I use these plants indoors?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Smaller varieties like lavender, basil, and peppermint can thrive on sunny windowsills. Place them near windows and doors that are frequently opened to create a natural barrier against mosquitoes entering your home.</p>
            
            <h3>How do I make a DIY mosquito repellent spray from these plants?</h3>
            <p>A simple recipe: Boil 1 cup of water and add 4-5 tablespoons of fresh herbs (like lemon balm, mint, or lavender). Let steep for 4 hours, strain, and add to a spray bottle with 1 tablespoon of witch hazel or rubbing alcohol. Spray on skin or around doorways (test on a small area of skin first).</p>

            <h2>✅ The Bottom Line: Plants as Part of Your Mosquito Defense Strategy</h2>
            <p>While plants alone <strong>won't eliminate mosquitoes completely</strong>, they significantly <strong>reduce their presence</strong> when combined with other mosquito-proofing methods. For comprehensive protection, use these plants alongside:</p>
